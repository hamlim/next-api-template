# Next.js API Template

This is a minimal API template built using Next.js.

It is meant to only support a headless API (e.g. no styles/layouts/UI etc), however you can adopt it and start to leverage some UI parts as you like!

## Getting Started

You can get this template in a number of ways:

- `degit`
    - `bunx --bun degit hamlim/next-api-template`
- Clone the repo
- Use the Template

Once you have the repo locally, you'll want to install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

and then start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
